"""Shared test isolation.

The live HALT_ENTRIES file (operator kill-switch) lives at config.HALT_FILE in
the project root. When it's present, rails_ok() short-circuits to HALT — which
would masquerade as / suppress every execution test. Point HALT_FILE at a
nonexistent temp path for every test so the suite never depends on (or is
poisoned by) the real runtime file. Tests that WANT a halt monkeypatch it back.
